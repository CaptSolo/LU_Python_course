    "## Front End Web Development vs. Back End Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Web development can be divided into two main categories: front end and back end.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Front End Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Front end web development involves creating the user interface and user experience of a website. This includes designing the layout, colors, fonts, and interactive elements of the website. Front end developers use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the visual elements of a website that users interact with.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Back End Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Back end web development involves creating the server-side logic and database interactions of a website. This includes handling user requests, processing data, and generating dynamic content. Back end developers use server-side programming languages like Python, PHP, Ruby, Java and others to build the server-side components of a website.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing APIs, handling user authentication, and managing databases are some of the tasks that back end developers are responsible for.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Full Stack Web Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Full stack web development involves working on both the front end and back end of a website. Full stack developers are proficient in both front end and back end technologies and can build complete web applications from start to finish. "
